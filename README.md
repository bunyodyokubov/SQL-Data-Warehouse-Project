🧱 Layer Descriptions

🥉 Bronze Layer
Purpose: Acts as a landing zone for raw data.

Data Format: Uncleaned, possibly semi-structured or denormalized.

Sources: CSVs, logs, external databases, APIs, etc.

Use: No transformation — just ingestion for traceability and audit.

🥈 Silver Layer
Purpose: Applies cleansing, deduplication, type casting, and basic transformations.

Data Format: Structured and query-ready tables (normalized or star-schema-friendly).

Use: Enables consistent downstream transformation logic.

🥇 Gold Layer
Purpose: Contains aggregated, enriched datasets optimized for analytics and reporting.

Data Format: Dimensional models (star/snowflake schemas), fact and dimension tables.

Use: Consumed by BI tools, dashboards, and reports.

🛠️ Technologies Used
SQL (PostgreSQL / SQL Server / MySQL / etc.)

[Optional] dbt, Airflow, or custom scripts for orchestration

[Optional] Power BI / Tableau / Looker for visualization

📊 Example Use Cases
Sales performance analysis

Customer segmentation

Trend and cohort analysis
